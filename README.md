[Javascript Password Generator](https://jenngreiner.github.io/javascript-password-generator-homework3/)


## User Story
As an employee to with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria, so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Description 
This project is my current working portfolio. To achieve a responsive, mobile-first design that allows users to view the web application on any device, mobile or desktop, I used BootStrap CSS grid formatting. This allows the navibar, images, and page contents to visually change depending on the width of the browser window. 

## Usage
Open the [Password Generator](https://jenngreiner.github.io/javascript-password-generator-homework3/) in your browser. Enter the desired password length when prompted, then indicated which criteria you wish to include in your password. Once the length and criteria have been selected, press Generat Password. A randomly generated password will appear in the text field.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
